# Likha Development Roadmap

This document outlines the complete development plan for Likha, divided into manageable phases.

## Development Strategy

### Recommended Approach: Monorepo with Incremental Development

**Why this approach:**
- Build core functionality first, then expand
- Each phase delivers working features
- Easy to test and validate as you go
- Community can start using basic version early
- Plugins can be developed independently

**Tech Stack Decisions:**
- **Build Tool:** Vite (fast, modern, great DX)
- **Package Manager:** pnpm (efficient, monorepo support)
- **Testing:** Vitest (fast, Vite-native)
- **Docs:** VitePress or Docusaurus
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions
- **Hosting:** GitHub Pages for docs, npm for packages

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Risk:** ProseMirror learning curve
  - **Mitigation:** Study examples, start simple, iterate
  
- **Risk:** Browser compatibility issues
  - **Mitigation:** Test early, use polyfills, set clear browser support policy

- **Risk:** Performance with large documents
  - **Mitigation:** Implement virtual scrolling, lazy loading

### Project Risks
- **Risk:** Scope creep
  - **Mitigation:** Stick to phases, defer nice-to-haves

- **Risk:** Burnout
  - **Mitigation:** Take breaks, get community help, celebrate milestones

- **Risk:** Competition from established editors
  - **Mitigation:** Focus on unique value (free, self-hosted, Laravel-friendly)

---

## Next Steps

1. **This Week:**
   - Set up monorepo structure
   - Initialize packages
   - Start ProseMirror learning

2. **This Month:**
   - Complete Phase 0 and Phase 1
   - Get basic editor working
   - Share early demo

3. **This Quarter:**
   - Complete Phases 2-4
   - Have working plugins and adapters
   - Start gathering feedback

**Remember:** Start small, ship often, gather feedback, iterate. The goal is not perfection but progress.
